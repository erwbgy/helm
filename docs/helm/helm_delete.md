## helm delete

given a release name, delete the release from Kubernetes

### Synopsis



This command takes a release name, and then deletes the release from Kubernetes.
It removes all of the resources associated with the last release of the chart.

Use the '--dry-run' flag to see which releases will be deleted without actually
deleting them.


```
helm delete [flags] RELEASE_NAME [...]
```

### Options

```
      --description string   specify a description for the release
      --dry-run              simulate a delete
      --no-hooks             prevent hooks from running during deletion
      --purge                remove the release from the store and make its name free for later use
      --timeout int          time in seconds to wait for any individual Kubernetes operation (like Jobs for hooks) (default 300)
```
